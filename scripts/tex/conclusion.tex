MetaModel means CMA equipped with a MetaModel, which is automatically enabled when the learning performs well.
ChainMetaModelSQP is a memetic algorithm: it combines MetaModel (hence, CMA plus a MetaModel) and a final run using a local method, namely SQP (sequential quadratic programming).
Usually, a meta-model and a fast local search a the end do improve evolutionary methods.

On benchmarks close to the good old BBOB, CMA and variants do perform well. The variants equipped with a MetaModel perform better, and
variants equipped with the the MetaModel and the final local search are even better.

On many real-world benchmarks, the budget is lower than in the traditional context of BBOB with budget $=$ dimension $\times$ 1000. There
are cases with a ratio budget/dimension $<1$, of the order of a few units or a few dozens. DE performs well in many cases.

SQP is excellent in noisy optimization. 

We include benchmarks with one or several or many constraints (prefix onepen, pen and megapen), tackled with dynamic penalization: results were not fundamentally different from the non-penalized case. 

MetaModel perform well on BBOB-style optimization, but were also excellent for several low budget things.
